The hal+json specification
==========================

The easiest place to read it is here: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal

Please contribute proposals for changes that you think will improve the spec!


How to propose a change
=======================

Simple:

Edit either the txt or the xml file, whichever one you want - and submit as a pull request.

Wonk-mode:

The txt is actually generated from the xml so it's better if you edit the latter.
You also get extra brownie points if you:
* install xml2rfc (`pip install xml2rfc`)
* generate the txt from the xml (`xml2rfc draft-kelly-json-hal.xml --text`)
* submit both in your PR
